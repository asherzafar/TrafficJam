<b>Description:</b>
<blockquote>
The Deloitte team consisting of practitioners from multiple practices, including Strategy, Analytics and Enterprise Risk (Niraj Dalmia, Nihar Dalmia, Riyaz Nathwani, Asher Zafar, and Manu Sharma) investigated the relationship between illegal street parking and congestion on Toronto roads. Using open data from the City of Toronto and data from TomTom, the team established a correlation between parking infractions and congestion.
<p><p>
Building on this insight, the team combined their knowledge of the transportation industry and deep analytics skills, using tools such as R, QGIS, and Alteryx, to identify specific hot spot areas in the city where there was a strong correlation, and investigated ways to utilize existing public and private assets to increase parking capacity. The team’s ‘hacking’ can be leveraged to predict traffic congestion better as well as find possible ways to simulate and optimize parking capacity in the city. The Deloitte team’s insights and methodology received many positive reviews and ultimately led them to winning the sponsor award!
